# ROBT403: Image Processing Homework Project 2
Visual illusion | Interpolation | Local histogram equalization implementation by using MATLAB

## Description
In this assigment it was required to implement some tasks in warmup part regarding Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation technique and Histogram
equalization by using MATLAB software, as well as to implement Floyd–Steinberg dithering. 

## Warmup
### Task 1.1
In this task by using Nearest-Neighbor Interpolation technique it was required to compare images, `Original` vs `Interpolated`. User can adjust desirable size of image Results can be observed below on the Figure 1:

### Task 1.2
This task required to investigate `"mystery image"` and reveal hidden elements by applying `histogram` and `local histogram` equalization. Results can be observed below on the Figure 2:

## Main part 
In this part, the visual illusion was implemented by using MATLAB. An interesting fact about our eyes is that they can be tricked to see more colours than it is in reality. You can observe the obtained results below. 1st image is a grayscale one with 256 levels, while the 2nd image has only two levels: black and white. You see grey tones on the right, however, it is only an illusion. I used Floyd–Steinberg dithering in order to complete this task.

## Good Luck!
