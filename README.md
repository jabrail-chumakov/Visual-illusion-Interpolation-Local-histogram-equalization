# ROBT403: Image Processing Homework Project 2
Visual illusion | Interpolation | Local histogram equalization implementation by using MATLAB

## Description
In this assigment it was required to implement some tasks in warmup part by using MATLAB software and to code script that will create mosaic from different small photos.

## Warmup
Loops and if statements weren't used because it was one of the task's condition. Image coordinate system was used; that is, x indexes the rows from top to bottom and y the columns from left to right.

### Task 1.1
Here a grayscale image of constant intensity 100 were created by setting size of image to `1000 x 1000`. Results can be observed below on the Figure 1:

### Task 1.2
This task required to make a grayscale image with alternating black and white vertical stripes, where each of them is 4 pixels wide. Results can be observed below on the Figure 2:

### Task 1.3
Here a grayscale image with a ramp intensity distribution, `described by I(x, y) = x/2`, were implemented. Note that it should not be fully gradient cause we have different aim in this task. Thus, results can be observed below:

### Task 1.4
A grayscale image with a Gaussian intensity distribution centered at (128, 128), described by following formula:

Thus, we need to implement something similar to gradient mask, where white color is centered. Finally, the following figure should appear:

### Task 1.5
The last task was just to make a color image where the upper left quadrant is `yellow`, the lower left quadrant is `red`, the upper right
quadrant is `green`, and the lower right quadrant is `black`. Results of this task can be observed below:

## Main part 
In this part photo mosaic was implemented by using `python`. I implemented this task with different shapes: `circle` and `square`. It can be regulated inside python code. It can take a while in order to render your final photo, cause I used high-quality images for both dataset and input. 

In order to run code just change directory to source folder and type `python main.py` or `python circle.py`. In case if you want to change size of the tiles, then you need to find this line `parser.add_argument("--stride", type=int, default=40, help="Size of small image")` and change `40` to bigger or smaller value. Note that dataset and output folder, as well as python files should be located in the same folder. Unfortunately I can't upload files more than `10 Mb` that is why you need to run these scripts by yourselves in order to observe results. I will put compressed results below. Square images:

## Good Luck!
